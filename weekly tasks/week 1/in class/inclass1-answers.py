These are the ANSWERS to the set of first exercises used in class.

The comments (marked by #) explain what you should do. Type your code below each comment.

#1. Assign values 5 and 3 to variables named first and second; print the values of the variables, one per line (this question is already answered)

first = 5
second = 3
print("first:", first)
print("second:", second)

#2. Add the values of first and second and store the result as the variable total_sum. Print the value of total_sum

total_sum = first + second
print("total_sum:", total_sum)

#3. Concatenate the values of first and second and store the result as the variable first_and_second (that is, 53 should be stored). Print first_and_second. Subtract 3 from first_and_second and assign this to the variable final_count.

first_and_second = int(str(first) + str(second))
print("first_and_second:", first_and_second)
final_count = first_and_second - 3
print("result:", final_count)

#4. Create a new variable, third, which has the value of 50. Print the variable.

third = 50
print("third:", third)

#5. Create a conditional statement that prints 'The values match' in case third and final_count are equal, and it prints 'The values do not match' otherwise. We want the two variables to be equal, that is, 'The values match' should be printed. You might need to do type conversion at this step.

if final_count == third:
    print("The values match.")
else:
    print("The values do not match.")

#6. Create a conditional statement that checks that first_and_second is greater than total_sum. If so, it prints 'Concatenation is greater than addition.' Otherwise, it prints 'Addition is greater than concatenation.' Of course, if everything is correct we would expect that the first message is printed.

if first_and_second > total_sum:
    print("Concatenation is greater than addition.")
else:
    print("Addition is greater than concatenation.")

# We will now use one module, random. We will do so to start learning how solutions we discussed in the first part of the course can be achieved brute force (by random sampling). The documentation about Python and its modules can be found here: https://docs.python.org/3.5/. The documentation about this particular module is here: https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/random.html. First, we import the module as follows:

import random

#7. Now, we want to randomly pick two letters from the string 'abcdefg'. We can do it as shown below. Check the documentation on https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/random.html to understand what random.sample does.

start_alphabet = 'abcdefg'

random_pick = random.sample(start_alphabet, 2)

print("".join(random_pick)) #ignore the part about join for now

#8. Let us encapsulate the behavior in the last piece of code. Write a function called two_letter_sample that will take any string as its argument and return a string with two randomly sampled letters if the original string is at least of length two. Check that the function gives a sensible output on a few strings.

def two_letter_sample(input_string):
    """
    Take a string and return a string with two randomly sampled letters.

    :param input_string: the string used for sampling
    """
    random_pick = random.sample(input_string, 2)
    return "".join(random_pick)

print(two_letter_sample("aef"))
print(two_letter_sample("abc"))

#9. Create a second function, called check_if_vowels. The function will take a (two-letter) string and will check that the string is either 'ae' or 'ea'. If this is so, the function returns True, otherwise it returns False.

def check_if_vowels(string):
    """
    Return True if the string is 'ae' or 'ea'.
    """
    if string == "ae":
        return True
    elif string == "ea":
        return True
    else:
        return False

#10. Create a third function, recursive_call. This function takes three arguments: input_string, repetitions, successes. The function repeatedly samples two letters on the input string (and it does so as many times as the number of repetitions). Whenever the sample consists of two vowels ('ae' or 'ea') it increments successes. Finally, it returns the number of successes.
#Note: this is a recursive function and some care has to be taken here. It usually helps to add print statemements to the function. 

def recursive_call(input_string, repetitions, successes):
    """
    Repeatedly sample two letters from input_string, count the number of times that the sample is the string 'ae' or 'ea' (# of successes)

    :param input_string: the string used for sampling
    :param repetitions: how many times the process should be repeated
    :param successes: the current number of successes
    """
    if repetitions > 0:
        #print("RUN")
        if check_if_vowels(two_letter_sample(input_string)) == True:
            successes = successes + 1
            #print("SUCCESS!", successes)
        successes = recursive_call(input_string, repetitions-1, successes)
    return successes

#11. Run the recursive_call function with 900 repetitions three times and store these results as output1, output2, output3. Then print the frequency of successes. 

output1 = recursive_call(start_alphabet, 900, 0)

output2 = recursive_call(start_alphabet, 900, 0)

output3 = recursive_call(start_alphabet, 900, 0)

print("Percentage sampled:", 100*(output1 + output2 + output3)/2700)

#12. The number will vary, but it should be close (up to 1 percent) to the probability arrived at analytically, i.e., the following number: 

print("Percentage solved analytically", 100*2/(len(start_alphabet) * (len(start_alphabet)-1)))
